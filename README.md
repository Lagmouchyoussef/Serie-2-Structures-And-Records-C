# Serie-2-Structures-And-Records-C
Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to familiarize you with the use of structures in C to model real-world objects. You will create several structures to represent different entities and then write a program that uses these structures to store and display information.

Instructions:
Definition of Structures:

Create a point structure that represents a point in 2D space. The structure should contain two members:

int x: the x-coordinate of the point.

int y: the y-coordinate of the point.

Create a car structure that represents a car. The structure should contain the following members:

char brand[50]: the brand of the car.

char model[50]: the model of the car.

int year: the manufacturing year of the car.

float price: the price of the car.

Create an animal structure that represents an animal. The structure should contain the following members:

char name[50]: the name of the animal.

int age: the age of the animal.

char type[30]: the type of animal (e.g., dog, cat, etc.).

Create a watch structure that represents a watch. The structure should contain the following members:

char brand[50]: the brand of the watch.

char model[50]: the model of the watch.

float price: the price of the watch.

int waterproof: an indicator (1 for yes, 0 for no) that indicates whether the watch is waterproof.

Writing the Program:

In the main function,

Create a record for each type of structure.

Assign values to each part of these records.

Display the result after filling each record.

Testing:

Test your program with different values to ensure it works correctly. Try displaying information about multiple cars, animals, and watches.

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness of the structure definitions.

Functionality of the program (correct display of information).

Clarity and readability of the code.

Remarks:

This exercise will help you understand how to use structures to organize data in C. You will also learn how to manipulate strings and use display functions to present information in a readable manner
